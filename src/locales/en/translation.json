        "desc1st" : "Project carried out during the 2022-2023 school year in a pair in Java. The initial project was to reproduce the game Pandemic. The game was supposed to be simulated in the console, and the algorithm was always supposed to make a choice (often leading to defeat). We decided to enhance this game according to a shared passion: The Lord of the Rings. We therefore modified the class names according to the races of Tolkien's universe. Moreover, the 48 cities in the original game were adapted to the fantasy universe, using information consistent with the book. Additionally, we implemented a 3D graphical interface with the OpenGL library adapted to the universe.",

        "desc3rd" : "My biggest project to date. It is a web-based library management site. The site allows you to manage books you have already read or wish to read. It features an interface resembling a physical library. It uses various APIs to retrieve book information (Google Books, OpenLibrary, etc.). You can find the site online at this address: <a href='https://bibliobooks.const-dev.fr' target='blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'><u>https://bibliobooks.const-dev.fr</u></a>. The project allowed me to learn how to manage large applications both on the backend and frontend, as well as the entire DevOps part for the site's deployment.",
